Creating the Python Interface to Nomad (PyNomad) is based on Cython 0.24 (or above) and Python 2.7/Python 3.6
A simple way to have Cython and Python is to install the Anaconda package.

Please note that NOT all functionalities of Nomad are available in PyNomad (beta version).

To build the PyNomad interface library:
   - Make sure to have the NOMAD_HOME environment variable set correctly
   - run the following in a command line: python setup_PyNomad.py build_ext --inplace

To install the PyNomad interface library for the current user
   - run the following in a command line: python setup_PyNomad.py install --user

Several tests are proposed in the directory to check that everything is up and running:
   - python runTestInfoHelp.py
   - python runTest.py
   - python runTest_2.py
   - python runTest_BlockEval.py
