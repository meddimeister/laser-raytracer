DESCRIPTION :

NOMAD is a C++ implementation of the Mesh Adaptive Direct Search (MADS)
algorithm, designed for constrained optimization of black-box functions.


WEB PAGE :

https://www.gerad.ca/nomad/


FURTHER INSTRUCTIONS :

Please visit the web page for futher instruction on the following:

* Downloading, configuring, compiling, and installing NOMAD
* Using NOMAD and setting the parameters
* Reports on NOMAD
* How to report bugs and make enhancement requests
* And more...


BATCH OR LIBRARY MODE :

NOMAD is designed to be used in two different modes : batch and library.
The batch mode is intended for a basic and simple usage of the MADS method,
while the library mode allows more flexibility.
For example, in batch mode, users must define their separate black-box program,
that will be called with system calls by NOMAD.
In library mode, users can define their black-box function as C++ code
that will be directly called by NOMAD, without system calls and temporary files.


EXECUTABLES :

On Windows and Mac OS X platforms, NOMAD batch mode executable is located in
directory $NOMAD_HOME/bin or %NOMAD_HOME%\bin.
In order to avoid compiling the code, you can simply use this executable.

COMPILATION :

On Linux, Unix, and Mac OS X, NOMAD can be compiled using the makefile generated
by the configure command located in $NOMAD_HOME.

On Windows, NOMAD can be compiled using the Microsoft Visual Studio projet
located in the %NOMAD_HOME_PERSONAL%\VisualStudio directory.


HOW TO EXECUTE NOMAD :

For informations about the execution of NOMAD, please read the user guide :

$NOMAD_HOME/doc/user_guide.pdf or %NOMAD_HOME%\doc\user_guide.pdf

or
